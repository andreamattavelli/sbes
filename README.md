#SBES
(Search-Based synthesis of Equivalent method Sequences)

SBES is a search-based technique to synthesize sequences of method invocations that are equivalent to a target method within a finite set of execution scenarios. The experimental results obtained on 47 methods from 7 classes (java.util.Stack and 6 from org.graphstream) show that the proposed approach correctly identifies equivalent method sequences in the majority of the cases where redundancy was known to exist, with few false positives.
