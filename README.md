# SBES
(Search-Based synthesis of Equivalent method Sequences)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreamattavelli/sbes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreamattavelli/sbes)

SBES is a search-based technique to synthesize sequences of method invocations that are equivalent to a target method within a finite set of execution scenarios.
The experimental results obtained on 47 methods from 7 classes (`java.util.Stack` and 6 from `org.graphstream`) show that the proposed approach correctly identifies equivalent method sequences in the majority of the cases where redundancy was known to exist, with few false positives.
